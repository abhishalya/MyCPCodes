# MyCPCodes

I have been practicing competitive programming since few days and to keep a track of the problems I solved, I thought it would be nice to have a repository which would keep the codes for all the problems I solved across platforms like [CodeChef](https://codechef.com) and [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com).

Following are the contests I participated in:

| S. No |                              Contest name                              | Problems solved | Rank |
|:-----:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------:|:----:|
|   1   | [December Long Challenge 2018 Division 2](https://codechef.com/DEC18B) |        2        | 4566 |
|   2   |  [Codeforces Round #527 (Div. 3)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1092) |        5*       |  --  |
|   3   |  [Codeforces Round #528 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contest/1087) |      2 + 2*     | 2380 |
|   4   |   [December Cook-Off 2018 Division 2](https://codechef.com/COOK101B)   |      1 + 2*     | 1330 |

`*` represents the problems upsolved (solved after the contest).

All the codes to the solved problems are in their respective folders. I would very happy if someone would like to contribute to the repository. I hope this would help many get started with competitive programming.

I would love to see where this journey takes me in a year or so :heart:
