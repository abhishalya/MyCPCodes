I have been practicing competitive programming since few days and to keep a track of the problems I solved, I thought it would be nice to have a repository which would keep the codes for all the problems I solved across platforms like [CodeChef](https://codechef.com) and [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com).

Following are the contests I participated in:

`*` represents the problems upsolved (solved after the contest).

All the codes to the solved problems are in their respective folders. I would be very happy if someone would like to contribute to the repository. I hope this would help many get started with competitive programming.

I would love to see where this journey takes me in a year or so :heart:
